# Todo List
A Full-stack Todo List app designed so that my girlfriend and I could have one shared todo list, so as we go about doing things, be it shopping or organising things we have a common list that's always in sync and up-to-date. It's a typical todo list in terms of design, but I added the possibility to follower others, so your todo list includes other people's too (functionality only possible through backend at the moment).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** NodeJS, Express, React, MongoDB + Mongoose, CSS
the app is orangised according to the MVC paradigm. The backend is built in Nodejs with express to set up the serve, the DB is MongoDB, with mongoose used for schemas. The frontend is all react, with CSS used for styling.

## Optimisations
This project was developed to help me practice my MERN stack skills as well as creating an app that would be genuinely beneficial for use in my daily life. This app is an MVP, it is functioning but there is a lot of room for optimisations. 
<br/>
Ideally I would like to add:
    <br/>
    -Add ability to follower others (to frontend): at the moment the abiltiy to follow others is only through the backend api
    <br/>
    -Add ability to remove followers: so users can see who follows their lists and can remove those they choose to
    <br/>
    -Add ability to accept or deny follow requests
    <br/>
    -Add ability to search for users on frontend.

## Lessons Learned:
There were many lessons in this project, it involved more use of React context and useReducer as well as developing custom hooks in react, which I'm improving my understanding and skills of. It was more practice implementing a fully organised MVC model for a project.
